# CHARts #

Character statistics for **your** source code! Tell `CHARts` where your code is, and it will count every single character, and give you some numbers at the end.

From the [annotated source code][annsrc]:

> Programmers love numbers. Numbers help shape things, turn amorphous blobs into definable structures. In that curiosity, I wrote myself a little utility for displaying the kinds of characters I use in source code. This isn't particularly useful for scientific work, except maybe for helping people decide which languages use more sigils, and if a particular language may increase the risks of RSI.
